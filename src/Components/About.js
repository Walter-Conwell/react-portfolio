          Hello! My name is Walter Conwell Jr. I'm a recent graduate of the Edx
          Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at the University of Denver. I've
          always been fascinated by the programming. And in recent years, I've
          been putting in a great effort to get better at the craft. In order to
          get better at the things we love, it takes time and effort. It feels
          like a short time ago when I was experimenting with C++ and Python.
          Now through intense perserverance and love of the craft, I'm a Full
          Stack Web Dev! While I lean towards UI, I am always eager to work on
          backend projects as well. I am very excited for the future
          oppurtunities and experiences that await! Check out the Portfolio
          section of this app! Or if you would like to reach out, go to the
