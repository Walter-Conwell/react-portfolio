          Hello! My name is Walter Conwell Jr. I'm a recent graduate of the Edx Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at the University of Denver.
          I've always been fascinated by the programming.
          And in recent years, I've been putting in a great effort to get better at the craft.
          In order to get better at the things we love, it takes time and effort.
          It feels like a short time ago when I was experimenting with C++ and Python.

          Now through intense perserverance and love of the craft, I'm a Full Stack Web Dev!
          While I lean towards UI, I am always eager to work on backend projects as well.
          I am very excited for the future oppurtunities and experiences that await!
          Check out my work!
          Or if you would like to reach out, Contact me!
